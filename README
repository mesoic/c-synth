C-synth offers a wide variety of chords. Major, minor, and several 7th
chords as well ! To run csynth, simply type "csynth".

WARNING: Csynth is in beta mode, and might not be stable on some systems.

probelms so be prepared to run "xset r rate 300 23" if for some reason
your keyboard does not revert to normal rate.
